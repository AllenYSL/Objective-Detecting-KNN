# Objective-Detecting-KNN
Using KNN from OpenCV python, a background subtraction method.


Before using this code, you need to install OpenCV python. If you are using OpenCV 4.4.0, you can use directly. If you are using vision <= 3.4.11, please change the code in knn.py, line 27 to fit it.


The threshold for detecting can be changed.


knn.py can generate images for each frame, using img2video.py can convert images to video.
